# Hotel Reservation

### Created on 26.07.2019

### Short project description

The core of this project consists of a formular to make a reservation at a hotel and an administration file 
to read the values and to search for specific parameters. The values for the reservation are written into a 
CSV-file. The administraion file reads the CSV to have a foundation for the search function.
